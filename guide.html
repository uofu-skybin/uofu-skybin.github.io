                                SkyBin is a peer-to-peer file storage application. Just like other online <br>
                                storage apps, it lets you store your files online, share them with people you <br>
                                know, and access them from multiple computers. The difference is that SkyBin is <br>
                                powered by a peer-to-peer storage network instead of a central service. So when <br>
                                you store a file in SkyBin, it gets placed on other users' machines, not on servers <br>
                                operated by SkyBin.
                            </p>
                            <p class="guide-content-paragraph">
                                This means that storage on SkyBin can be cheap, but it's also designed to be <br>
                                secure and reliable. SkyBin encrypts your files end-to-end and guards against <br>
                                data loss and corruption through periodic storage audits and redundant storage <br>
                                built on a technique called erasure coding. These features allow the system <br>
                                to recover your content even if other users go offline or try to tamper with <br>
                                your files.
                            </p>

                                With SkyBin, you can also rent out your unused disk space to other users on the <br>
                                network in return for cash. You get paid through Paypal, so it's easy to setup <br>
                                and get started.

                                users.

                                sharing with other people. It's how people you know can share content with you <br>
                                later on.

                                With SkyBin, you can rent out your unused disk space to other users by running a provider <br>
                                node. This is a server on your computer that stores other users' files. Before you set up a <br>
                                provider node, though, you'll need to make sure that your network is configured to allow <br>
                                incoming traffic. This will require that you have a publicly accessible IP address and <br>
                                that your firewall settings don't permit incoming connections.

                                the "Provide Storage" tab to register a provider node.

                                Here, you'll need to set your node's address, how much space you want to provide      <br>
                                to the network, and your pricing policy. The pricing policy determines how much       <br>
                                you charge for storage, and the algorithm used by your node to set your storage rate. <br>
                                With an "aggressive" policy, your node will try to undercut other users' prices on the<br>
                                network; with a "passive" policy, your node will generally follow the network average <br>
                                rate; and with a "fixed" policy, you set the prices yourself.

                                application. You can monitor its status, including things like network traffic, how much<br>
                                space is being used by other users, and your current storage rate by navigating back to <br>
                                the "Provide Storage" tab at any time.

                                Renter nodes store files with other users in SkyBin. They perform operations    <br>
                                like encrypting and uploading files, determing where to store chunks of data,   <br>

                                which the typical user interacts with to perform basic operations in SkyBin, and<br>

                                Provider nodes provide storage to the network, negotiating storage agreements <br>
                                with renters, storing file blocks, and serving other users' content. Any user <br>
                                with spare disk space can run a provider node to rent out their space for cash.

                                The SkyBin Metaserver stores file and user metadata, manages payments, and   <br>
                                serves as a meeting place for renters and providers. This is a global service<br>
                                operated by SkyBin.

                                Storage in SkyBin revolves around agreements called storage contracts. When a <br>
                                renter would like to reserve storage space with a provider, they do so with a <br>
                                storage contract, setting terms like how much space the provider is willing to<br>
                                provide, the duration of the agreement, and the total fee the renter must pay <br>
                                for the space. These agreements are negotiated behind the scenes by the SkyBin<br>
                                system; users don't have to think about them.
                            </p>

                                Files are stored in SkyBin as encrypted chunks after being preprocessed by the renter  <br>
                                who uploads them. This process includes compressing the file, encrypting it with a     <br>
                                symmetric key (AES), breaking it into fixed-size data blocks, and then computing parity<br>
                                blocks from the data blocks using an erasure coding scheme. Both data and parity blocks<br>
                                are then stored on the network with providers the renter already has storage contracts <br>
                                with. Metadata about the file, including the location of the blocks, is stored with    <br>
                                the SkyBin Metaserver.

                                The erasure-coding scheme used to create parity blocks for the file is based on<br>
                                Reed-Solomon codes. This is an error correction technique that allows SkyBin to<br>
                                recover file content despite partial data loss. If some data block is          <br>
                                irrecoverable or corrupted, a combination of data and parity blocks can be used<br>
                                to reconstruct it. The approach is better than the more obvious recovery       <br>
                                technique of storing multiple copies of files because any single parity block  <br>
                                can be used to recover any single data block. For more information about this  <br>
                                interesting technique, the BackBlaze blog has a useful primer:                 <br>
